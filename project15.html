        Assiut
    </h1>
    <div class="par6">
        major general ibrahim hammad, governor of assiut, accompanied by officials of the egyptian food bank and coca-cola international company, opened development work for four villages in the province of basra, fima, beni mar and beni mohammadiat.
<br>
<br>
this is part of the development project of 100 most needy villages implemented by coca-cola and the egyptian food bank,
 which began in 2011 and will continue until 2020, where the development hubs of the villages in this partnership include the development,
  maintenance and supply of schools, retooling and development of health units and supplying them with the necessary medical equipment and 
  supplies, delivering clean drinking water to the unable and providing small projects to the most needy families in the villages
  <br>
  <br>
  maj. gen. ibrahim hammad, governor of assiut, stressed the importance of civil society's role in cooperating with the government to provide
   services to citizens, especially in upper egypt, which has suffered from severe neglect over the past many years, explaining that state and 
   government institutions pay great attention to assiut, especially since it is a central capital, in order to advance development in upper egypt
   <br><br>
   the governor praised the role of the food bank and coca-cola company in developing and developing 4 villages and providing services to citizens in cooperation and participation of the government sector represented in the province, the egyptian shifa bank and a number of ngos, demanding wider participation of the private sector, ngos and all civil society institutions in providing greater services to citizens in poor
villages.
<br><br>
the governor added that we are working on a plan to develop 30 villages in the province of the poorest villages and will start with 5 villages, and then a complete plan will be drawn up to develop 25 other villages, with the aim of improving the standard of living of citizens and bringing about a comprehensive change in their lives, which will have a positive impact on changing the perception of upper egypt to take a better position than in the past decades to return assiut the locomotive of development in egypt and the tribal
face.
<br>
<br>
dr. ghada mcaday, regional director of communications and external relations of coca-cola, praised the achievements achieved in the project, stressing that the company adopts a clear and real strategy to serve the egyptian community consisting of several projects for community development, the most important of which is the project to develop 100 villages with the participation of the egyptian food bank, in which the development of 23 villages has been completed so
far.
<br>
<br>
the success of this project is the result of the concerted efforts of the private sector and civil society organizations with the government sector, which he considered the triangle of success of serious community development in
egypt.
<br>
<br>
this partnership with the executive bodies in assiut governorate comes in the development project of 100 villages as part of the giant project of the egyptian food bank, which also includes other axes for development, including the development of veterinary units in the villages, and the activation of civil society for development through awareness, training and revitalization of the projects of ngos in villages and awareness campaigns in various fields and the provision of medical convoys and convoys of
good.
