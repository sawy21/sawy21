    <h1>Egyptian Food Bank</h1>
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="par6">

    <h2> Software Innovation</h2>
    <br>
    <br>

    
    creating daily, monthly and seasonal programs to eliminate hunger and to suit the needs
     of the various beneficiaries, including: monthly feeding, school feeding, fasting breakfast 
    and sacrificial instrument " monthly feeding is one of the most continuous and successful programs of the egyptian
     food bank since its launch", through which it seeks to provide dry meals to families most in need on a monthly basis 
     in order to achieve decent living 
    and to compensate them for lack of income or inability to provide their needs.

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Database of eligible persons</h2>
<br>
<br>
the egyptian food bank operates through an integrated database of eligible families,
 which reached one million households due with details of their needs.
the food bank serves three main categories: citizens below the poverty line and 
unable to work and category 2: the head of the family who cannot meet his needs and those of his basic family,
 and then the third category: the poor who are able to earn during the education and rehabilitation phase "girls who drop out of education,
  young people in training and rehabilitation in a variety of letters, 
children at different stages of school and enrolled in literacy programmes".
<br>
<br>
<h2>Use food to facilitate development programs
</h2>
<br>
<br>
through our experience in the field of food and 
over the past 15 years and after thorough study of the cases we serve,
 we found that there are a range of cases due capable of work and gain and therefore, through the management 
 of programs and development projects, we have created a range of development programs through which we can develop the individual 
 who is able to play his role in society.
<br>
our role in this period is to provide the able individual with the "gift" of the food bank during his education until he is rehabilitated.
<br>
<br>
<h2> Raising awareness of the non-waste of food from the point of view of preserving blessings,
</h2>
<br>
<br>
raising awareness of not wasting food is a fundamental issue for the egyptian food bank, 
and therefore since its inception the individual and the institution are made aware of the amount of 
food wasted daily, whether from homes or even from parties in hotels or large restaurants,
 which can benefit a large number of the lowest-income and most needy citizens.
 <br>
<br>
<h2> Partnerships and leadership in providing solutions
</h2>
<br>
the egyptian food bank has established a system of thousands of charities 
accredited by the ministry of social solidarity to achieve the spread of its services in
 all provinces and establish the rules of humanity and respect for the needy, integrity and honesty
  and not to mix religion and politics in charitable work. the bank develops the performance of its original associations through training
 and capacity-raising to work in a professional and structured manner.
 <br>
 <br>
<h2>
    Investing in activity-related projects
</h2>
<br>
<br>
the egyptian food bank uses investment in supporting its various programs with related projects such as
the packaging factory, which produces thousands of parcels of dry food in high quality daily and a farm of abundance of fattening and
 dairy production, which serves the sacrifice instrument program and also 
contributes to the creation of jobs.
<br>
<br>
<h2>
    Volunteering as a basis for fighting hunger
</h2>
<br>
<br>
the egyptian food bank publishes the thought of volunteering by collaborating with every individual, company and institution 
interested in helping the poor in egypt, so he created a range of different programs that suit the preference of donors and volunteers
 in the belief that hunger can only be eliminated with the help of all members of society.
the culture of volunteering is also spreading by integrating younger generations into volunteering, such as the food bank generation initiative.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Providing the foundations for a vdecent life</h2>
<br>
<br>
believing in the importance of providing the foundations of a decent life for those living in poverty, we decided to expand vertically
 by establishing good banks starting with the egyptian shifa bank, the egyptian kassa bank and the bank 
of decent life.
<br>
<br>
<h2> Regional and international role in fighting hunger

</h2>
<br>
<br>
the egyptian food bank has exported the business model to 88 countries in the middle east, africa, south asia and latin america,
 and the bank's system of work has been adopted by the united nations to 
be an international model.
<br>
<br>
<h2> Full preparation with an immediate and effective relief system</h2>
<br>
<br>
since the establishment of the egyptian food bank in 2006, we have been keen to stand by the egyptian citizen in disaster
 situations by helping him and providing him with the food and needs needed to overcome the crisis he is going through by 
 helping volunteers and donors who provide assistance immediately
 after the crisis.
 <br>
 <br>
<h2>  The beginning of the caravan programme </h2>
<br>
<br>
 starting in 2011 we added to the relief program after another, which is the program of convoys of good,
 which is a drum to study and explore the living, economic and health conditions of the villages to provide 
 immediate assistance from food, treatment and 
clothing to lift the suffering of marginalized groups.
